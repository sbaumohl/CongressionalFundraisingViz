# Congressional Fundraising Database API

Rust Backend for a project concerning congressional FEC filings and reports, meant to track who and where congressional candidates receive their money from.

This Rust Backend is a Graphql server using SeaORM and Seaography and assumes a Postgres backend.

My data is from:

- [FEC's official filings](https://www.fec.gov/data/browse-data/?tab=bulk-data), providing the official filings of congressional candidates and federal fundraising committees.
- [Propublica](https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/)'s Congress API, providing biographical data and voting records of individual lawmakers.

This backend was created as a Rust learning experience just as much as it was for the end product.
